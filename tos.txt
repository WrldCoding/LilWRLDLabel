we arent that greedy on money even though it costs you money for full full ownership thats because it costs money to get those rights we cant just get them for free fees? what are fees we dont charge fees (maybe tax for the premium and full rights) but that doesnt matter right yes we do not giveaway your info as we said before because we are secure if someone hacks our database we got it under controll first the domain that your seeing isnt the real domain so if we disconnect it or if someone ddos it it wouldnt do anything to our real servers our servers are secured by cloudflare and google cloud and last but not least repl.it so if we were to get hacked they would need to hack all of that to get to our servers and its cool the creator of this website his face is unkown he doesnt realy know what hes doing well were just kidding but considiring that this website is really new he is acctually new fun fact at the moment we have 28 files that have been coded in and the creator is a kid and i am that kid ok anyways so our servers our securely secured and if someone were to hack it i have all of the code downloaded so i can just upload all of it and get on with my day your music wont get hacked either as we are the distributors if there was supposed to be a warrant on my computer that affected me i would say that im not guilty because you gave your music to me straight up and i put this in the terms of service
